## About MG

MG (Morris Garages) is a British automotive marque with a rich history dating back to the 1920s. The company has gone through several ownership changes and has evolved significantly over the decades:

### Generations

- **British Sports Car Era (1924-1980)**: Founded in Oxford, England, MG initially produced sporty variants of Morris cars. The company became famous for its open two-seater sports cars, including iconic models like the MG T-series and the MG MGB. During this period, MG established itself as a producer of affordable sports cars with distinctive styling and handling characteristics.

- **British Leyland & Rover Group Period (1980s-1990s)**: After being incorporated into larger British automotive conglomerates, MG continued producing sports cars but also expanded into sportier versions of standard Rover models. Notable vehicles from this era include the MG RV8 and the MG F, the company's return to the two-seater roadster market.

- **MG Rover Period (2000-2005)**: Following BMW's breakup of the Rover Group, MG operated as part of MG Rover Group, producing sportier variants of Rover's sedan lineup alongside the MG TF roadster. This period ended with the company's bankruptcy in 2005.

- **Chinese Ownership Era (2007-present)**: After acquisition by Chinese automaker SAIC Motor, MG was revitalized as a global brand. The company shifted focus to producing modern hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs. This current era has seen MG expand into electric vehicles and enter markets worldwide with a focus on affordable, technology-rich vehicles.
